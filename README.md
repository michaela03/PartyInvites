# ðŸŽ‰ Party Invitations Management - ASP.NET Core MVC ðŸ’Œ

This is the README file for the Party Invitations Management project implemented using ASP.NET Core MVC. The purpose of this project is to create a web application that handles party invitations and allows users to indicate whether they will attend the party or not. If the status is set to attending, the application will display a list of other guests attending the party.

The Party Invitations Management application will have the following features:

1. **Invitation Creation**: Users can create party invitations by providing details such as the event name, date, time, and location.

2. **Guest List Management**: Users can add and remove guests from the invitation's guest list.

3. **RSVP**: Guests can indicate whether they will attend the party or not by updating their RSVP status.

4. **Guest List Display**: If a guest indicates that they are attending the party, the application will display a list of other guests who have also confirmed their attendance.

5. **Authentication and Authorization**: The application will have user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can create invitations and manage guest lists.
